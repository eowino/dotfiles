# Getting started with AppleScripts

To run these scripts as an application:

1. Open the Script Editor application
2. Copy and paste the AppleScript code into the editor
3. Save it in the Applications folder. Make sure to use the **Application** file format.
4. Now you can run it using Alfred/Spotlight
5. You may need to give it permission to run on its first execution. To do so:
    - Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility.
    - Add the app from step 3
